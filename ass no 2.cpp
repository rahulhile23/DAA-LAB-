Movie Recommendation System Optimization
A popular OTT platform, StreamFlix, offers personalized recommendations by sorting movies
based on user preferences, such as IMDB rating, release year, or watch time popularity.
However, during peak hours, sorting large datasets slows down the system.
As a backend engineer, you must:
● Implement Quicksort to efficiently sort movies based on various user-selected
parameters.
● Handle large datasets containing of movies while maintaining fast response times
