/*Scenario : Emergency Relief Supply Distribution A devastating flood has hit multiple villages in a remote area,and the government,along with NGOs,is organizing an emergency relief operation.A rescue team has a limited - capacity boat that can carry a maximum weight of W kilograms.The boat must transport critical supplies,including food,medicine,and drinking water,from a relief center to the affected villages.Each type of relief item has :
● A weight(wi) in kilograms.
● Utility value(vi) indicating its importance(e.g., medicine has higher value than food).
● Some items can be divided into smaller portions(e.g., food and water), while others must be taken as a whole(e.g., medical kits).
As the logistics manager, you must : 
1. Implement the Fractional Knapsack algorithm to maximize the total utility value of the supplies transported.
2. Prioritize high - value items while considering weight constraints.
3. Allow partial selection of divisible items(e.g., carrying a fraction of food packets).
4. Ensure that the boat carries the most critical supplies given its weight limit W.
